Cloud-Native Campsite Booking Platform

Designed and implemented a full-stack campsite booking platform with an end-to-end DevOps CI/CD pipeline. The application is containerized using Docker, orchestrated on AWS EKS (Kubernetes), monitored using Prometheus & Grafana, and deployed through GitHub Actions integrated with Helm and Terraform.
